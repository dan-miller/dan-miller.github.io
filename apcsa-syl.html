            While some changes may occur, in the absence of significant delay or disruption, the schedule below will be adhered to. Major project and assessment dates
            are generally fixed. We have a substantial amount of material to get through. Unplanned "no-school" days (weather, etc) may or may not
            result in changes to the schedule.

        <h2>
            Course Details
        </h2>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Advanced Placement Computer Science A is an advanced, rigorous introductory Java programming course, equivalent to a first year programming course in a college science or engineering program. Specific topics covered are listed in the schedule at the end of this syllabus. Students who complete this course and secure a 3, 4, or 5 on the AP Exam may be eligible for college credit. Please confirm all credit eligibility with the academic institution(s) of your choice.</p>
        <p>The full Course and Exam Description is available on the College Board website.</p>

        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommended: AP Computer Science Principles/Introduction to Programming - successful completion or equivalent programming experience.</li>
            <li>Recommended: Algebra II - C or higher, or concurrent enrollment.</li>
            <li><em>Note: prior experience in Java is not required for this course.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>AP Exam</h4>
        <p>In order to obtain college credit, in addition to successful completion of this course, students must earn a 3 or higher on the AP Computer Science A exam. Some colleges require scores higher than a 3; verify with the institutions of your choice. Testing accommodations must be approved through College Board, and should be brought to the attention of the Counseling office as soon as possible. Requests for accommodations made after November 15 are not guaranteed to be approved.</p>
        <p>The exam consists of two Sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Section I: Multiple Choice - 40 Questions, 50% of Exam Score</li>
            <li>Section II: Free Response - 4 Questions &lpar;Multi-Part&rpar;, 50% of Exam Score</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The exam will be given digitally. FRQ responses will be typed.</p>

        <h4>Factors to be Evaluated</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit Tests and Projects: 45% of Quarterly Grade</li>
            <li>Quizzes and Labs: 35% of Quarterly Grade</li>
            <li>Problem Sets and Daily Marks: 20% of Quarterly Grade</li>
            <li>Final Exam: 20% of Final Grade</li>
            <li>Final Grade Calculation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>40% S1 = 50% Q1 + 50% Q2</li>
                <li>40% S2 = 50% Q3 + 50% Q4</li>
                <li>20% Final Exam</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.henricoschools.us/page/secondary-grading-scale">Henrico County Public Schools Secondary Grading Scale</a> will be used for this class. Per <a href="https://www.henricoschools.us/page/grading-practices-and-high-school-class-rank">HCPS policy</a>, students will earn 1.0 quality points in their GPA calculation for enrollment in each AP class.</p>

        <p>Students will generally have the opportunity to submit corrections for quizzes and tests for partial credit reward. Certain corrections may be required by the instructor and may result in a penalty to the final score if not submitted.</p>

        <h4>Make-Up Work Policy</h4>

        <p>Students are responsible for the timely completion of work missed due an absence. Work will be accepted without penalty up to five (5) school days after returning to class from an EXCUSED absence.</p>
        
        <p>All class materials, lecture notes, slides, etc. are posted online. Students should check the syllabus/Schoology/class website for information on what was missed if they are absent.</p>

        <h4>Late Work Policy</h4>

        <p>Timely completion of work is crucial for student success in this class. Work will be accepted up to four (4) school days late, at a penalty of 10% off the grade PER DAY. After the fourth day, a zero will be entered.</p>

        <h4>Academic Integrity Policy</h4>

        <p>A student's submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be the student's own work product. Students shall be guilty of academic misconduct and/or cheating if they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Represent the work of others as their own</li>
            <li>Use or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic work</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>This includes the unauthorized use of AI technology, including code generation tools such as Ghostwriter or Copilot.</strong>There may be exceptions to this policy that permit the use of AI, but they will be clearly communicated.</li>
                    <li>Students are generally permitted to use online resources responsibly, including sites such as StackOverflow, so long as they are cited.</li>
                    <li>Students are generally permitted to collaborate in class, peer-program and -debug, and otherwise work together to solve problems. However, it is the expectation that each student submits their own work representing <em>their</em> best effort.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Give unauthorized assistance to other students</li>
            <li>Modify, without instructor approval, an examination, paper, record, or report for the purpose of obtaining additional credit</li>
            <li>Misrepresent the content of submitted work</li>
            <li>Attempt to hack, subvert, "trick", or DDoS an autograder</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Course Materials</h4>

        <p>There is no physical textbook for this class. Reading materials, videos, supplemental materials, etc will all be provided by the instructor or linked from this site.We will use CSAwesome as our "online textbook." CSAwesome contains readings, videos, and embedded interactive activities and exercises. Access it <a href="https://runestone.academy/">here</a>.</p>

        <p>To encourage active listening and to promote college- and career-ready skills, students will be expected to take notes during class. The instructor will provide each student with a composition notebook. Students may use their own materials if they choose, but it must be a paper medium. Electronic devices may not be used for journaling or notetaking. Notebooks may be checked periodically for a quiz grade.</p>

        <h4>Expectations of Students</h4>

        <p>This is a college-level course for college-level credit. Students will be expected to perform at a high level and demonstrate a high degree of academic maturity. The student bears the responsibility of keeping up with the syllabus and published due dates, understanding requirements, managing their workload, and planning appropriately.</p>

        <p>There is a great deal of interactive, hands-on work in this class that requires active student participation. Refusal to engage or participate will result in grade penalties and disciplinary action.</p>

        <p>Disrespect towards others and disruption of the learning/working environment will absolutely not be tolerated in any form and will be met with swift consequences.</p>

        <p>Personal electronic devices (phones, smartwatches, etc) are not permitted to be used during instructional time. Devices will be confiscated and the student will be referred to administration for disciplinary action if they are seen to be in violation of this policy. Headphones may not be worn during instructional time.</p>
